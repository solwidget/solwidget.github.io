<h3 class="onefive"><font color='#888888'>SUNRISE AND SUNSET DASHBOARD WIDGET</font></h3>

<p>Sol is a Dashboard widget that tells you what time sunrise and sunset are,
as well as dawn and dusk.</p>

<p align='center'><img src='solwidget/widget.png' /></p>

<p>The analog display is a 24-hour clock, with noon at the top and midnight
at the bottom. The dark region is nighttime, the light part is daytime,
and the slivers in between are dawn and dusk. (Or, for the technically
inclined, they are <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_twilight'>civil
twilight</a>.)</p>

<h2>Submit a Translation</h2>

<h2>About the <i>Apple - Downloads - Dashboard</i> Listing</h2>

<p>Apparently shortly after the release of the Mac App Store (with Mac OS X
version 10.6.6 on 2011-01-06), it became impossible to submit any further
updates to the <i><a
href='http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/'>Apple - Downloads -
Dashboard</a></i> site.  As a result, downloading the Sol widget from
there (Sol can be found in the <i>Information</i> category) is now stuck
permanently pointing to the Sol-1.3.1.wdgt.zip download.  For this reason,
the Sol-1.3.1.wdgt.zip download has actually been replaced with the most
recent Sol version (currently 1.3.4) as of the time (2014-01-15) that the
ability to update these downloads was disabled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the googlecode site went defunct in 2015 and was
transitioned to archive-only status.  However, there is a redirect so
that when clicking on the Dashboard Widgets download link one ends
up on the googlecode archive downloads page for the Sol widget.
Although this is not ideal, one more click there will actually start
the download so it is not all bad.</p>
